# diff2
For while, just a very basic version of `diff` command.

# Why?
`diff` is a useful command-line software, but I hate its output. My intention with this project is to try to create a more friendly output solution than the original `diff`.

# Installation
After cloning the project, inside the folder execute the following command:

```sh
$ make install
```
